# Iguan-client-php
High-performance events library for PHP with Web and CLI Hooks with [Iguan-server](https://github.com/IguanREQ/Iguan-server).

### Installing
`composer require iguan-req/iguan-client-php`

### Usage
A library was developed for almost zero-configuration, safety and handy running. You can see it in [examples](/examples) by yourself.

A library can be easily extended by using custom realization of almost each class. You can redefine default behavior of everything or
even implement own algorithms, emitters, subscribers very easily.  

Note: before usage, make sure that you have ran an [Iguan-server](https://github.com/IguanREQ/Iguan-server).
